#
# Two images from one build, each a single static binary on a distroless
# nonroot base:
#
#   docker build -t ghcr.io/lightwebinc/bbox .                             # the command (default)
#   docker build --target devchain -t ghcr.io/lightwebinc/bbox-devchain .  # the local chain
#
# The builder is pinned by digest and is a later toolchain than go.mod's
# floor, so scanning sees the standard library that ships.
#
# No ENV defaults are baked in. The hosts, the header source, the node and
# the settlement leg are addresses of somebody's deployment and have no
# default anywhere: a default would send an envelope, or a reader's
# question, to a server nobody configured. Pass them as BBOX_<KEY>
# variables or in a config file (docs/usage.md).
#
# The command keeps an identity's state (key, coin pool, state file) under
# $BBOX_HOME, ~/.bbox by default, which is /home/nonroot/.bbox here. The
# image carries that directory, empty, owned by nonroot and mode 0700, so a
# new named volume mounted there starts with the same owner and mode:
#
#   docker run --rm -v bbox-home:/home/nonroot/.bbox ghcr.io/lightwebinc/bbox init
#
# A volume mounted on a path the image lacks is created root-owned, and
# every write to it is then refused. A bind mount keeps the host
# directory's owner instead: make it writable by uid 65532, or run with
# --user.

# The builder runs on the build machine's own platform and cross-compiles
# to the target's, so an arm64 image needs no emulation.

# no peers, and nothing it mines is money. Its journal, which replays the
